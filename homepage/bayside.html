      <p class="promo-title1">BAYSIDE: THE ANAMOLY OF NEW YORK</p>
      <p class="p2">For the typical New Yorker, waking up to the sounds of sirens while getting ready to go to work—all while watching an array of people walk by their block multiple times—is something that isn’t out of the ordinary. Many in New York City are used to the sounds of cars passing by, the smell of many different restaurants and food trucks, and the inevitable experience of socialization. Perhaps even the annoyance—whether it be through public transportation or a short walk on the rather daring and long blocks of Manhattan—of the random, somewhat disturbing, glares everyone gets while swiftly getting to their destination.</p>
      <p class="p3">Then comes Bayside, Queens, the anomaly: a place that is New York but without its blood, its bulk, its culture. Bayside does not have the constant relevance of hipsterdom that is so presently shown in Brooklyn; Bayside does not have the diverse restaurants or the densely populated areas within a typical Queens neighborhood, all endowing what their culture has to offer; Bayside does not have that hard-working, individualistic aspect of Manhattan; Bayside does not have that relentless, tough aspect of the Bronx; Bayside does not even have the feeling of a typical, suburban, and residential aspect of Staten Island which many people love and enjoy. Bayside is, in effect, a place of boredom. Many will disagree and put Staten Island in that category. But unlike Bayside, Staten Island has its own subway line and ferry; Bayside is remotely close to a subway station and, based on the remote possibilities in Bayside, disincentivizes people to come here. But this disincentivization is inherently not a bad thing. Bayside is just a neighborhood that cries to New York to stop exploiting, to stop travelling, and to stop expanding: to just relax. It, in effect, yells, “Stop!” when no one is inclined to do so.</p>
      <p class="p4">While the average New Yorker will always hear what is now called “the sounds of New York,” the average Baysider will start off the day to the sounds of birds chirping, of wind blowing, of local chatter, or of tall trees waving—of static, constant, and hushed sounds. The lack of buildings, which, in New York, menace their defiance upon the people on the streets, brings the unctuous appearance of the sky to its fullest exposure; the lack of new copious faces makes the neighborhood more amicable; the lack of infrastructure brings the face of nature to its fullest potential. The wind feels more robust; the trees more ingratiating. These characteristics of such a neighborhood forces the locals to dawdle, for the absence of such an environment forces the person to appreciate the sky above them, the grass on the ground, the quietness in the air, or the people around them.</p>
      <p class="p5">Such a neighborhood is lost, but, I believe, such a neighborhood is needed in New York: one must, in effect, take a moment to appreciate the things around them, to stop and pay attention to the world in which New York City once was and how beautiful it once looked, to say “hi” to the same people at the same time, or to just have a place, an entity, a thing, to just relax—to reflect.</p>
